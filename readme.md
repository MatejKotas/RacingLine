# Program to generate racing lines for cars around racing tracks

I did my best to replicate the algorithm in this youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqoSJFyvVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuqoSJFyvVE)

I recommend not using this repository for any of your needs or wants. Go find a better algorithm. I wrote this over the course of a few days.

However, if you *really* want to use this repo;

Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the program, default settings should work fine:
```
python3 main.py
```
